### üåê Language AI
**Applications:**
- Detect language of a text  
- Extract entities (names, locations, organizations)  
- Extract key phrases  
- Understand sentiment of text  
- Classify text based on content  
- Translate text between languages  

**Generative Language Tasks:**
- Create stories, poems, or essays  
- Summarize text  
- Answer questions (Q&A systems)  
- Generate image captions  
- Complete sentences or paragraphs  
- Convert text ‚Üí speech  

---

#### Text as Data
- Text is **sequential** (sentences contain ordered words).  
- Computers understand only numbers ‚Üí need **tokenization** (convert words into numeric tokens).  
- Sentences vary in length ‚Üí use **padding** to equalize input size.  
- To measure word similarity ‚Üí use **dot product** or **cosine similarity** on **embeddings** (vector representations of words).  

---

#### Language AI Models
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):** processes sequences, keeps hidden state for context.  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** advanced RNN with gates to retain long-term context.  
- **Transformers:** process data in parallel using **self-attention** for better context understanding (foundation for GPT, BERT, etc.).

### üéôÔ∏è Audio & Speech AI

**Applications:**
- Speech ‚Üí text (speech recognition)  
- Speaker recognition  
- Voice conversion (change speaker‚Äôs voice)  
- Speech emotion recognition  
- Text ‚Üí speech (speech synthesis)  

**Generative Tasks:**
- Music composition  
- Synthetic speech generation  

---

#### Audio as Data
- Audio = sequence of digitized **snapshots of sound waves**.  
- **Sampling rate:** number of times per second sound is recorded (e.g., 44.1 kHz = 44,100 samples/sec).  
- **Bit depth:** number of bits used to represent each audio sample.  
- A single sample reveals little ‚Äî need many samples for meaningful features.
